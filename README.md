Advanced Neural Network Architecture For Brain Lesion Detection 

This is a project on brain tumor detection and i have applied Deep neural networks machine
learning models in this project mainly vgg16 , inceptionv3 and xception, and 
i have compared them in this project.

Dataset 

As i cannot upload the dataset on github below is the link for the Dataset.
Br35H :: Brain Tumor Detection 2020 

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection

I have taken this dataset from Kaggle ,
and in my brain tuumor detection i have reached best accuracy of 98% 
from Vgg16 model
